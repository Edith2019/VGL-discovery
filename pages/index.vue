            Dear VGL team, please find here a little disovery app mostly about
            Algolia technology. As I was getting to know your stack, I realised
            that I was not familiar with
            <a href="https://www.algolia.com/" target="_blank"> Algolia</a>
            yet. Therefore, I decided to play around by setting it up using
            <a href="https://algolia.nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank">
                nuxt/algolia</a
            >
            library with a client and SSR implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
